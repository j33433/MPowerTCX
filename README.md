# MPowerTCX
Convert Schwinn MPower Echelon2 CSV files to portable TCX for use with Strava, GoldenCheetah, etc.

## Getting the MPower CSV Data
1. Insert the USB thumb drive into the slot at the top of the MPower unit
2. Spin so hard you break the pedals off!
3. Stop pedalling
4. Press "AVG/MAX" for 5 seconds. The USB logo will flash a few times. Wait for the flashing to stop and remove the drive
5. The USB drive should now contain a file named MPower.csv

## Problems with USB Thumb Drives
This MPower Console appears to reject or even crash when a newer model USB drive is used. A 1GB drive is your best bet.
If the USB logo fails to flash at the end of a ride, or the unit shuts off (crashes), you probably have an incompatible drive.

## Problems with Files
I only have one model of indoor bike. It's possible that your bike produces a different file format.

If you file doesn't work, feel free to send it my way.
