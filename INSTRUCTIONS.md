1. Work out
1. Stop pedalling
1. Press "AVG/MAX" for 5 seconds

## Problems with USB Thumb Drives
Some consoles reject or even crash when a newer model USB drive is used. A 1GB drive is your best bet.

If the USB logo fails to flash at the end of a ride, or the unit shuts off (crashes), you probably have an incompatible drive.

## Problems with Files
I only have one model of indoor bike. It's possible that your bike produces a different file format.

If your file doesn't work, feel free to send it my way.

## Converting your workout file to TCX

### Step 3 - Adjust and click "Save TCX..." 

In this example the power meter on the bike reads too high by about 4%. The power values are adjusted down by using a negative value. 

By default, the workout time will be set to the timestamp on the CSV file. If you want to set a custom time, uncheck "Use File Time as Workout Time" and adjust the time.
